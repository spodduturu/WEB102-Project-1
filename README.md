## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Responsive Design: I had to adjust the grid layout to ensure that it worked well both on desktop and mobile formats.
Dynamic Data: Ensuring that each event card received the appropriate content and links involved testing different ways of passing props into the EventCard component.
Styling the Cards: Making the cards visually appealing while maintaining clarity and a good user experience took some time. I had to fine-tune padding, margins, and link styling to make it clean.
